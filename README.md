Scope Management: Keeping costs under control helps prevent scope creep, where additional features or changes lead to increased expenses. This ensures the project stays focused and aligned with its original objectives.

Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns
Detailed Budget Planning: Start with a comprehensive budget that includes all anticipated costs—such as development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Break down the budget into detailed line items to get a clear view of where funds are allocated.

Regular Monitoring and Reporting: Continuously track expenses against the budget. Use project management tools and financial software to monitor real-time costs and generate reports. This helps in identifying deviations early and taking corrective actions.

Change Control Processes: Implement a robust change control process to manage any changes to the project scope or requirements. Assess the financial impact of changes and get approval before proceeding. This prevents unplanned expenses from impacting the budget.

Resource Management: Optimize resource allocation to avoid overuse or underutilization. Ensure that team members are working efficiently and that their efforts are aligned with project goals.

Contingency Planning: Set aside a contingency budget to cover unexpected costs or risks. This buffer helps in managing unforeseen expenses without affecting the overall budget.

Vendor and Contract Management: Negotiate clear and fair contracts with vendors and service providers. Ensure that terms are agreed upon in advance and that there are mechanisms to handle any potential cost overruns.

Cost-Benefit Analysis: Regularly perform cost-benefit analyses to evaluate the financial impact of decisions.

Stakeholder Communication: Keep stakeholders informed about budget status and any potential issues. 
Performance Metrics: Use key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure financial performance and project efficiency.

Training and Awareness: Ensure that the project team is aware of budget constraints and the importance of cost control. Provide training on financial management practices if necessary.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Answer:
Agile and Waterfall are two prominent methodologies in software development, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here’s a comparison highlighting their main advantages and disadvantages:
